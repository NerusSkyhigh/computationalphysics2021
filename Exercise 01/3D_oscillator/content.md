1. Python code used for plotting the wavefunction. This is the only thing this code does, but we could include some plots in the final report if we like the idea!
2. C code with the complete solution
3. Folders containing the energy levels for different number of points

# TODO

I will upload some useful plots of the wavefunctions we obtain
