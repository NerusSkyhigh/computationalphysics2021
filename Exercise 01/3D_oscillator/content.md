1. Python code used for plotting the wavefunction. This is the only thing this code does, but we could include some plots in the final report if we like the idea!
2. C code with the complete solution
3. Folders containing the energy levels for different number of points
4. Pictures showing all the wavefunctions obtained. In each picture the "exact" wavefunction is shown and compared to the functions obtained at one dE of difference
