## Variable Mesh length

1. Pyhton code, correct apart from initial conditions, takes like 6 centuries to run.
2. C code, complete, correct and with good speed.
3. .csv files containing the required energy levels for different mesh lengths.
4. Plots of energy levels and difference from exact values.
5. Folder for data analysis with variable mesh density

# TODO

Maybe find a way to fix initial conditions in a more systematic way... now they are fixed case by case according to the exact solution.
Plots for the variable mesh density folder.
